/**
 * Represents a quaternion, which is used for representing rotations in 3D space.
 * Quaternions offer advantages over Euler angles, such as avoiding gimbal lock
 * and allowing for smooth interpolation of rotations.
 * <p>
 * A quaternion is typically represented as {@code q = w + xi + yj + zk}, where
 * w is the scalar part, and (x, y, z) is the vector part.
 * <p>
 * Note: This class is currently a placeholder. A full implementation would include
 * fields for the quaternion components (e.g., x, y, z, w) and methods for
 * quaternion operations such as multiplication, normalization, inversion,
 * conversion to/from rotation matrices or axis-angle representations, and
 * spherical linear interpolation (slerp). Many quaternion operations are
 * already present as static methods in {@link MyMath}.
